# Whisper Transcriber Lambda

> DISCLAIMER: this project was built almost entirely with Claude ai, either through the web UI or through the Warp terminal integration

## Summary

OpenAI's whisper voice transcription model deployed to a python lambda function invoked behind an APIGW with simple token-based auth. Given a base64-encoded audio file of spoken English, this lambda will return the text transcription.
